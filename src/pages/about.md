Hello! I'm Malik. Welcome to my thoughts space.

I started my journey in tech as a software developer, eventually moving into staff engineering roles, and now I work as an Engineering Manager in the loyalty fintech space.

This blog is where I share reflections on that journey, thoughts on software development, leadership, technology trends, and other things I'm learning along the way.
