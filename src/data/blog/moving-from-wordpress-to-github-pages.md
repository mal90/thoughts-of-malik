## Moving from Wordpress to Github Pages - Part 1

### Starting with Blogger
I started blogging few years ago when I was still new to programming. I wasn't really sure what to blog, but I wrote bits and pieces of what I thought fascinating. I started off with [blogger](https://lazydevguy.blogspot.com/) platform back in 2014. Interestingly my very first blog post on the internet is about creating infinite energy out of a buttered cat which is [called buttered cat paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buttered_cat_paradox) ðŸ™ˆ. Now when I look back, I am not really sure why I spent time on blogging about something so stupid and meaningless. Similarly when I look at some of the older posts I have written, I cannot really understand what was going through my mind. This is similar to some of us react to our older tweets and facebook posts I guess. Top cringeworthy ðŸ˜€.

### Moving from Blogger to Wordpress
After a while, I started migrating from blogger to Wordpress. Mostly because the blogger platform UI started to get too boring for me and Wordpress offered many cool features for free which blogger didn't provide at that time. For example, Wordpress had a nicer admin panel where we could edit articles more efficiently. I was happy with Wordpress for few more years where i have written handful of articles.

### Moving from Wordpress to Github Pages
Back in 2020 June, I posted my last article on Wordpress. I remember writing this article while serving my 2 weeks [quarantine period](https://www.instagram.com/p/CBFRXnCjSvzsC7xx9iiky9FXD_8hsXVlh3BeHc0/). Not entirely sure why I stopped writing since then. I think one reason could be because I was spending more time with my daughter and I had less time for other activities such as gaming, reading, regular exercising as well as blogging.

Few months ago, one of the old articles i have written got featured on my company [blog](https://loyalty.dev/posts/lessons-ive-learnt-as-a-code-reviewer) which actually reminded me that I used to blog ðŸ˜€, However my current Wordpress blog didn't interest me enough to write new stuff. I wanted something new and something of my own to make my self motivated to start writing again. This is why I started moving to Github pages.

### Why Github Pages
Github Pages wasn't my first choice. I looked at some popular choices during this period such as Hugo and Jekyll. But I chose GH Pages for few reasons.
1. Quite easy to setup.
2. Tied to your Github account, so you get a domain with your Github account.
3. Quite flexible with easy configs and can use github actions to automate your workflow.
4. It is also free.

### Setup specs for the new blog and questions
I had few problems I had to solve initially.
1. How would I setup the blog with GH pages (basic architecture, technologies)
2. How would I write the blog posts and store it.
3. How would I serve my blog posts.
4. How would I allow comments to be posted for my posts.
5. How can I analyse the traffic and data of my readers.

As you can see, writing your own blog from scratch isn't that easy and quite honestly there are number of online tools just do these things for you out of the box, so you can just focus only about writing the content and not having to worry about all these setting up. But I was bit stubborn ðŸ™ƒ and I wanted to try creating a blog from scratch.

### Learnings so far
It took me few months to motivate myself to complete the setup, migrate all posts and finally write this article after not writing anything for more than 2 years. But I think learnt few new things about creating a blog on my own.

https://mal90.github.io/ is not 100% complete. But I am off to a decent start. I also have a big backlog of topics I wanted to write here. I just need make free time to put my thoughts and knowledge i have learnt into posts ðŸ¤ž.

### Wrapping things up

In my opinion, everyone who code should write about things they learnt. Even if the topic is trivial and common, when you write about it, you get the chance to dig deeper about it and ultimately you have a real chance of mastering it. When I look back some of the things I have written, I come to realise how insignificant they are. But again, the things I have written those days have definitely helped me to achieve my current position âœŠ.

Expect a follow up post on the technical details on how I created the blog from scratch.
