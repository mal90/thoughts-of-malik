## Youtube color combination issue?

Recently I noticed something annoying with Youtube's settings menu.

The color combination they've used for the toggle switch for Autoplay, Annotations are virtually unidentifiable. Both switch on,off states have been differentiated using a grayish color combination. So for example, you have to really look twice to know whether the  Autoplay is switched on or off.

### After adding some contrast to "on" state in toggle button. Making it bit more intuitive

See now it looks slightly better. A basic rule in UX is that when you want to differentiate two states in UI, you go for complementary color rule.
